Python codes for Introduction to Computational Stochastic PDEs,
CUP (2014)


    This book gives a comprehensive introduction to numerical
    methods and analysis of stochastic processes, random fields
    and stochastic differential equations, and offers graduate
    students and researchers powerful tools for understanding
    uncertainty quantification for risk analysis. Coverage
    includes traditional stochastic ODEs with white noise
    forcing, strong and weak approximation, and the multi-level
    Monte Carlo method. Later chapters apply the theory of random
    fields to the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs with
    correlated random data, discuss the Monte Carlo method, and
    introduce stochastic Galerkin finite-element
    methods. Finally, stochastic parabolic PDEs are
    developed. Assuming little previous exposure to probability
    and statistics, theory is developed in tandem with
    state-of-the-art computational methods through worked
    examples, exercises, theorems and proofs. The set of MATLAB
    codes included (and downloadable) allows readers to perform
    computations themselves and solve the test problems
    discussed. Practical examples are drawn from finance,
    mathematical biology, neuroscience, fluid flow modelling and
    materials science.

the book (see the MATLAB/ directory for copies of these codes by Chapter).
